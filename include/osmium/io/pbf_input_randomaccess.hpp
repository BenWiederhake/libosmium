Note that this is likely to hit the same few indices in the beginning, thus quickly populating key indices, and reducing the search space dramatically in the first few iterations. If an unpopulated block_start is encountered, proceed with the next stage. Otherwise, return a result as per above rules.
             * 2. Scan the remaining search space linearly. Since this does not access the underlying file, and scans a std::vector, this should be reasonably quick. Whenever a populated block_start is encountered, update begin_search or end_search accordingly. If this reduces the search space to zero or one blocks, return a result as per above rules. Otherwise, proceed with the next stage.
             * 3. At this point, the remaining search space must have length two or more and must contain only unpopulated block_starts. At this point, there is no way to make a good guess: Return the block index in the middle of the search space.
